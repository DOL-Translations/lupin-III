You have to make the mp4 exported at 640 x 352, while you may be able to do it at lower resolutions, this is what the oringal scene uses. Verify that the video you're rendering out is also in 29.97 fps, and not 60.

To get the orignal thp files, on a J copy of Disc 2, open in gcrebuiler, go to the movie folder, then export last_00.thp and last_01.thp. From there, you'll be using https://github.com/Lord-Giganticus/THP-Converter to convert the thp to mp4. Once that is done, download ffmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows, when downloaded, Add ffmpeg's bin folder to PATH to make things very easy for you. Once all is done, and you have your modified videos you want to replace, you want to make sure the audio Hz is set correctly, most programs default it to 44 or 48 hz which is too high, so a new folder and cd into it with cmd. 

In the cmd, paste in `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ar 32000 output.mp4`. input.mp4 will the the file you want to modify and output.mp4 is the new file being made, so don't name these the same thing! If you don't do this, it'll lag the video/audio in game from it being too high quality, otherwise it'll lag the video/audio. Once you do the conversion, you'll want to download https://github.com/Wiimpathy/WiiFlowTHP and edit the .bat with the following settings. 

set FPS=29.97
set BORDER=0
set WIDTH=640
set HEIGHT=352
set DURATION=813
set QUALITY=86
set "NOAUDIO=--audio"
REM set "SKIP=--frameskip"

Adding a border can net you some higher numbers in the quality settings, but I don't find it worth while. For the duration, 00 is 813 seconds, 01 is 193 seconds. If you decide to translate to a different language or something, the quality setting may be required to change As long as it's less than or equal to the orignal file size, it'll fit last_00 is 784 MB, last_01 is 181 MB. We put the duration to the next whole second because it doesn't do floating points for numnbers, so the next second will make sure it'll capture everything. Drag the updated mp4 into the bat and let it do its thing, it'll take a bit. Once finished, in the thp folder, you'll have the new thp to replace. Make sure the file name is the last_0X, or else it wont work!

To quickly test this, import it through gcrebuiler, and go to the end of disc 1, and make a save state, once pressing no when asked to save, it'll start to play the thp, and you'll be able to see what you've done!

You could put techinally ANY video you want, but it'll be at an insanly low resolution, and there's other programs that play things that are a LOT easier to setup, such as https://github.com/GameCubeHomebrew/homebrew-media-player

Also you didn't rip the video wrong, the lip sync is just that bad, and I struggle to even wonder why.
