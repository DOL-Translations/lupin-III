1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,830
We're 28 meters deep.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,990
Keep it steady.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,960
Do you see anything?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,860
There is no change in the monitor.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,200
We should be close by.

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,900
Proceed with caution.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,740
Yes.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,240
Are you okay?

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,870
Claustrophobic, are you?

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,940
Some hero you are.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,010
There must be one or two

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,680
things that you're afraid of!

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,680
Aren't you the energetic one?

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,450
What's that?

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,490
Looks to be a gigantic
blue hole ahead of us.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,890
Blue hole?

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,530
It's like a limestone cavern
at the bottom of the sea.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,930
The inside is uncharted and dangerous.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,830
Descent into it.

20
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,500
Huh? I mean... that's...

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,470
The location indicated by the Kirim
is inside of here.

22
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,140
So please, enter it.

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,440
Y-yes sir.

24
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,850
Visibility is at 50.

25
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,220
It's quite creepy here.

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,250
We're at depth 41, 42...

27
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,620
Currently 43 meters,
and still descending.

28
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,390
This seems never ending.

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,660
What's going on?

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,230
What's wrong?

31
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,260
The water temperature
is rising rapidly.

32
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,400
86, 96, 104 degrees.

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,000
The water temperature?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,610
Also, moisture levels in the sea water
are 50 more

35
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,910
than the average.

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,940
Is it an underwater volcano?

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,480
<i>Okay, the kids are right below me.</i>

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,190
<i>But, man, what's up with this hole?</i>

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,320
<i>The water's gotten hotter
all of a sudden.</i>

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,460
<i>It's like a hot spring in here.</i>

41
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,090
<i>If it weren't for this suit, I'd be in trouble.</i>

42
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,430
<i>Huh?</i>

43
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,770
What's wrong??

44
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,230
There's a strong current!

45
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,740
It's too dangerous to keep going!

46
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,970
Just keep going!

47
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,870
We must follow the Kirim's direction!

48
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,130
An ominous hole...

49
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,700
A bottomless drop...

50
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,210
Theo, do you remember
the sleeping dragon story?

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,040
What are you mumbling about?!

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,480
Shut up!

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Liana!

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,680
Quiet kid, I don't care about you!

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,180
Now talk! What were you saying!?

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
If you're an Oceanfolk
then you should know

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,220
the sleeping dragon story.

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,580
The what?

59
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,390
The sleeping dragon
at the end of the world.

60
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,200
I get it. It was talking about Saludo.

61
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,430
Start talking plainly.

62
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,200
Don't pretend you never heard of it.

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,970
Your mother or father never told you?

64
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,700
What?

65
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,410
What happened?

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
The tide is changing even more!

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,310
I can't control the sub now!

68
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,400
Nothing is broken in the sub.

69
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,590
The water temperature is back to normal.

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,090
Okay.

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,560
Finally awake, are you?

72
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,400
Liana, what's going on?

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,830
The Dragon's Fang.

74
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,740
The Dragon's Fang...

75
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,360
That is the sleeping dragon,

76
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,010
the sacred home
of the Oceanfolk, Saludo.

77
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,180
So, this is the entrance?

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,880
Yes.

79
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,220
The fangs, in this case,
are likely the Kirims.

80
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,750
The Kirims take the place of a key.

81
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,520
Have you really never heard the story?

82
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,030
Give me the Kirims, and I'll open it.

83
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,230
Don't try anything funny.

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,260
Don't forget, he's still here.

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,930
Don't worry.

86
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,270
I'll keep my word.

87
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,680
Man, what a rough swim.

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,610
So this must be the entrance to Saludo.

89
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,630
Amazing... The light is beautiful.

90
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,800
The air is pure here, too.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,770
Liana!

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,770
So this is Saludo...

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,710
Liana.

94
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,180
This must be the dragon's belly,

95
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,780
full of beautiful scales.

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,640
Huh?

97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,680
The stories were all true.

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,980
You're right.

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,420
Enough sightseeing.

100
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,890
You have to show us around the place.

101
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,960
I'm not some tour guide!

102
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,830
I've never even been here!

103
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,190
You seem to bring up the story often...

104
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,900
I really didn't know anything, up until now...

105
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,570
I thought it was nothing more
than a bedtime story.

106
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,940
But this is the first time I've been here.

107
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,470
Well, this is our home now, so

108
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,370
we must explore the place.

109
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,810
Two of you guys, stay here.

110
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,480
Yes sir!

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,490
But why is there light down here?
And oxygen too?

112
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,820
I can't explain the light, but the oxygen

113
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,460
was made from stromatolites
2 billion years ago.

114
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,130
It's claimed the plant

115
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,930
created all the oxygen currently on Earth.

116
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,900
Quite magnificent, isn't it?

117
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,500
Another boat is approaching us.

118
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,840
Look who it is.

119
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,510
Where is Lupin?

120
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,480
He's a little busy.

121
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,140
Where are the kidnappers?

122
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,180
Went this way, then went that way.

123
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,480
I see, so Lupin went into the ocean?

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,690
Don't you think you're overdoing things?

125
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,760
Mind your business, I'm scuba trained!

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,790
I'll dive down there to catch Lupin if I must!

127
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,700
Pray for me that I won't be eaten by sharks!

128
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,930
Hope you don't get eaten by sharks.

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,240
Amazing...

130
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,210
Liana... what is this stuff?

131
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,780
Hey!

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,550
What's the meaning of this?

133
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,850
There's a lot of stones here...

134
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,180
maybe this is the graveyard
for the Oceanfolk?

135
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,620
A grave?

136
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,350
These stones are graves?

137
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,220
A tomb for the Oceanfolk?

138
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,520
Is that it?

139
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,760
We can't stop now! There must be a way...

140
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,960
The legend must be more than a stone!

141
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,430
This wasn't in the damned legend!

142
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Where could it be?

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,200
I don't know anything.

144
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,710
Don't play dumb!
Where is the great power?

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,580
What are you looking for?

146
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,780
What do you think
the great power actually is?

147
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,910
You little brat!

148
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,050
Liana!

149
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,720
Stop!

150
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,290
Please... stop it...

151
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,760
I think I understand.

152
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,560
Saludo is a cemetery for the Oceanfolk.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't you feel it, too?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,830
The desire to rest in peace undisturbed,
one with the ocean?

155
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,740
That wish led
to the building of this place, Saludo.

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,910
The great power doesn't exist.

157
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,580
For the last time...

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,410
Tell me where the great power is.

159
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,980
I told you!

160
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,950
It doesn't exist!

161
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,820
Is that so?

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,160
Your're a monster...

163
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,090
I won't ask again. Where is it?

164
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,780
Where is the great power?

165
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,580
The great power of Saludo.

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,630
Behind the dragon's frozen tears.

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,700
What?

168
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,400
Probably past the stalactites up ahead.

169
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,170
I see.

170
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,210
Then you can lead the way. Come this way.

171
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,250
Good girl. Shall we get going?

172
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,190
You two, wait here with the boy.

173
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,020
Yes sir!

174
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,700
Theo...

175
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,100
Theo.

176
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,370
Theo!

177
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,900
Uncle...?

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,640
Are you okay, Theo?

179
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,340
How did you get here?

180
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,650
That's right, Liana... Where's Liana?

181
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,780
It's likely Zai took her.

182
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,880
Now is not the time to be sitting down.

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,290
Get up, Theo, we have to save Liana!

184
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes!

185
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,780
The frozen heart...

186
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,820
Is this the great power!?

187
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,820
Now, how do I use the Kirims, Minupa?

188
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,990
Kirims? What are you talking about?

189
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,730
They're still stuck in the entrance.
You should know that.

190
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't you worry about that!

191
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,870
Now, how do I use them?

192
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,740
You can't! If the dragon runs wild,

193
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,110
something awful will happen.

194
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,740
Tell me!

195
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,110
No!

196
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
Liana...

197
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,910
Theo, what's wrong?

198
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,380
I just heard Liana's voice!

199
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,580
We have to hurry!

200
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,280
OK!

201
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,660
Stubborn girl. No matter.

202
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,330
Once I've obtained the power,
I'll take my time dealing with you.

203
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,300
The Kirims are reacting!

204
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,020
This is it! I finally found it!

205
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,690
Don't!

206
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,500
This is it! This light!

207
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,870
The light that even God fears!

208
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,040
The great power is in my grasp!

209
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,680
At this rate, we're done for!

210
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,450
Jigen, look over there.

211
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,180
Huh?

212
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,100
What the...?

213
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,240
Don't tell me this is the great power!

214
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,640
Liana!

215
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,670
Theo! Lupin!

216
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,110
Liana! I'm coming!

217
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,180
Don't come here!
You two stay away from the light.

218
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,850
If anyone other than an Oceanfolk touches this light,

219
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,950
they'll be evaporated!

220
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,460
Magnificent!

221
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,640
It's finally mine! The great power!

222
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,070
What is this?

223
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,910
What's happening?

224
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,740
Why am I-

225
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,850
Liana!

226
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,990
Theo! I'm glad you're safe!

227
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,790
Are you okay too, Liana?

228
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,920
Yes, I'm fine!

229
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,890
Sorry to break up this touching reunion,

230
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,860
but we should hurry and get out of here.

231
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,830
You two go ahead. There's something

232
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,730
important I have to do first.

233
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,630
What are you talking about, Liana?

234
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,100
What's so important at this moment?

235
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,600
That.

236
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,240
Huh?

237
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,310
The frozen heart. It's starting to melt.

238
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,940
Soon, something terrible will happen.

239
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,310
It must be sealed before then.

240
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,580
Then, I'll go with you!

241
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,320
No! You can't come with me!

242
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,250
I already told you, if you're not an Oceanfolk,

243
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,650
you'll be evaporated too!

244
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,860
No way, Liana. It's too dangerous.

245
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,020
That's right!

246
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,760
Don't worry, I'll be fine! I'm a Minupa!

247
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,160
Liana...

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,500
I'll go with you!

249
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,430
She's a Minupa so she'll protect me!

250
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,870
Guess there's no helping you kids.

251
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,610
I guess you can go with her.

252
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,280
I bet she will protect you, no matter what.

253
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,610
But if it gets too dangerous,
I'll bring you back.

254
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,310
Yes!

255
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,260
You pulled out the Kirims,
but nothing changed.

256
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,960
Taking out the Kirims won't seal it.

257
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
We have to insert them in the opposite way.

258
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,760
Got it.
