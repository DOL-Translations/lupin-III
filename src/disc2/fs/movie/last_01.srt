1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,920
The light should rest now.

2
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,880
Uncle!

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,880
Awake, are ya?

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,990
You guys did it!

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,990
Where is Liana?

6
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,950
I'm over here!

7
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,450
Liana!

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,560
We can't keep delaying things!

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,460
We may not be able to escape
from this place!

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,330
What the-

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,230
Where did the submarine go?

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,800
Those black suits must've run off with it.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,540
Damn it...

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,250
Z-Z-Zenigata?

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,750
I've found you, Lupin!

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,720
What are you doin' here, Pops?

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,490
I found your friends

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,260
and they showed me
where you were underwater.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,860
Then I found this
and thought you were here.

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,260
But it was people

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,000
who kidnapped the children
for "Power".

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,700
Well, I guess you win again, Pops.

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,880
In any case, we're saved.
C'mon you two.

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,980
Yes!

25
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,480
Liana?

26
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,780
Liana? What's wrong?

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,050
It's my mother.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,690
Huh?

29
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,720
I was giving thanks to my mother
for the light.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
The light?

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,130
I got to see my mother
in the Oceanfolk's light.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,300
She's the one who told me
to seal this place.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,030
So no one else
could touch it again.

34
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,700
But, if we don't hurry-

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,940
Hey!

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,840
Gotta hurry if we wanna get outta here!

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,710
You're not getting away this time!

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,940
I get it already.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,650
Ready?

40
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,510
Yes.
